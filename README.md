# 100 Days of React

My goal: Learn modern React, Next.js, Redux, React Query, and Tailwind by coding every day for 100 days.

I am following the course:  
**The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More (Jonas Schmedtmann)**

This repository will contain:

- Daily learning folders (`/days`)
- Short notes for each day
- Practice exercises and mini-projects
- Bigger portfolio-ready apps (`/projects`)
- Weekly time summaries (Toggl Track)
